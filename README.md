# The Housing List

This application serves as a directory for intentional communities, allowing users to browse and submit information about various communities, including their names, links, statuses, and locations. The application is built using a Python back-end server and a JavaScript-based front-end.

## Features

- Browse a list of intentional communities with their details, such as name, link, status, and location.
- Submit a new intentional community to the directory (subject to validation by the maintainer).
- Request edits to existing community information.

## How to Use

Visit [thehousinglist.org](https://thehousinglist.org/) to start using the application.

1. Browse the list of communities displayed on the main page.
2. To submit a new intentional community, fill out the form at the top of the page with the community's name, link, status, and location, and click "Add a new intentional community."
3. To request edits to an existing community, click the "Request Edit" link in the "Actions" column of the table. This will open an email template with the maintainer's email address and a pre-filled subject line and body. Edit the email body to include the proposed changes and send the email.
